## Exploring the Impact of Guardian Characteristics on Student Performance and Health Outcomes.

### Executive Summary
This report examines the relationships between guardian categories, student performance, and health outcomes. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between mother's education, study time, and student grades, as well as notable differences in health categories and absenteeism rates between students with different guardian types.

### Introduction
The dataset analyzed in this report contains information on students' academic performance, health, and demographic characteristics. The study aims to identify patterns and correlations between these variables, with a focus on the role of guardians in shaping student outcomes.

### Methodology
The analysis was conducted using filtering and aggregation techniques to examine the relationships between guardian categories, student performance, and health outcomes. The dataset was filtered by mother and father categories, and average values were calculated for grades, health, absenteeism, and alcohol consumption.

### Data cleaning/preparations.

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task.
 - Data loading and inspection.
 - Handling missing values
 - Data cleaning and formatting.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial exploration of the dataset revealed:

- Students with mothers as guardians tend to have higher grades and better health outcomes.
- Father guardianship is associated with higher health categories, particularly "excellent" health.
- Study time is positively correlated with grades, but only up to a certain point (5 hours).

### Findings/Results
Mother Category Analysis
Students with mothers as guardians have average grades of 70%, average health ratings of 3.55, and average absenteeism rates of 3.67. Alcohol consumption indices are relatively high at 1.5. Notably, students in the "poor" health category have the highest average absenteeism rates (4.2), followed by those in the "good" health category (4.0). Students with mothers having higher education tend to perform better academically.

Father Category Analysis
In contrast, students with fathers as guardians tend to have higher health categories, with:

- 45% of students in the "excellent" health category
- 30% of students in the "good" health category
- 20% of students in the "fair" health category
- 5% of students in the "poor" health category

Average absenteeism rates are lower across all health categories, with an overall average of 2.8.

### Study Time and Grades
Students whose mothers are guardians tend to achieve higher grades with study times between 2-5 hours. Longer study times (>10 hours) are associated with lower grades.

### Discussion
The findings suggest that mother's education and involvement have a significant impact on student academic performance and health outcomes. However, father guardianship is associated with higher health categories, particularly "excellent" health. This highlights the importance of considering the role of both mothers and fathers in shaping student outcomes.

### Recommendations
1. Educators and policymakers should develop targeted interventions to support students from diverse family backgrounds.
2. Parents and guardians should prioritize education and health promotion to improve student outcomes.
3. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms driving the observed correlations and to inform evidence-based policies.

### Limitations
This study has several limitations:

- The dataset may not be representative of all students, as it may be biased towards certain demographics or regions.
- The analysis relies on averages and aggregate values, which may mask individual variations.
- The study does not control for other potential factors that may influence student outcomes, such as socioeconomic status or access to resources.
